**AKA The better Scratch Forum Leaderboards - better name, better code, not (as) ew stinky**

postpercent is a website to visually display various statistics for users of the Scratch forums. The data is fetched courtesy of [DatOneLefty's ScratchDB](https://scratchdb.lefty.one/).

## Current Features

- View the leaderboards for users in each forum category
- View post amount, rank and history for each user

## Planned Features

- Make various code improvements (some things were written into the program quite hastily)
- Show the user's post count history for each forum category

## Build Instructions

- Download the repository's files, using `git clone https://github.com/rirurin/postpercent.git` or however else you want to do it
- Type `npm i` in the root of the postpercent directory
- Type `npm run dev` to run postpercent with live editing, or `npm run preview` to test a production build (Svelte will default to `localhost:3000`)
